# hello-world
My first repository

Welcome all, I'm SamusDrake and programming enthusiast.

My primary languages are C and Java, but I have used others from time-to-time.
I'm mostly self taught but I did learn software development and interaction design with the Open University in England.
I hold a Diploma in Computing and carried on to earn a BSc( A degree! ), until I felt ready to stand on my own two feet.

Projects over the years have ranged from small DirectX games, software rendered demos, Android apps, zx spectrum and megadrive programming and now, finally, VR demos for the Oculus Go.

Thank you for popping in!

SamusDrake.
